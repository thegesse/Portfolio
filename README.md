# Portfolio project
---

## About
### All good devs have a portfolio, well this is going to be mine, at least until I'm unhappy about it and decide to change it again.
### This portfolio is made with tools I havent used before or havent used much, such as docker or Spring boot, or even JavaScript I had so much fun making it 
### and I hope to be able to make many more and update this portfolio with things like, languages, new color schemes, easter eggs 😉...
### I hope you enjoy navigating this portfolio and all the changes I'll be adding in the future

## How to navigate
### This portfolio is built like a terminal so use the commands provided to see the various information about myself that I put in it 
### also here is the link thowards the website, I am using the free hosting service so it may take around minute to launch if it was previously put into innactivity, I do apologize for that. [Website](https://terminalportfolio-q24p.onrender.com/)


## How it was made

### This project was made using Java and Spring boot, in an afternoon, it was then deployed on render.com for free website hosting, I am also very innexperienced in JS as this was built so ai was used for the frontend, I apologize for the vibe coding in advance.
